PLAST - Java project
====================

This project contains:
----------------------

1. a sample Java application to illustrate the use of PLAST native binary from a Java
   application;
   
2. some Fasta sample files to use as query and subject files to run PLAST comparison jobs; 

3. PLAST pre-compiled native libraries for Linux and MacOS;

4. the "plast.jar" library required to develop Java PLAST-based applications;

5. an Ant "build.xml" file to handle the project; type "ant help" in your terminal for 
   more information.

6. ".classpath" and ".project" files to import this project into Eclipse. 


Requirements
------------

1. Oracle Java SDK 1.7 or above;
2. Apache Ant 1.9.1 or above.


Testing software
----------------

This project is self contained, so you can easily test it on the command-line. Using a 
terminal, type in the following commands:
ant cmp
ant run


About PLAST binary
------------------

Inria/Genscale Team provide PLAST binaries for "older" systems to enable its use more 
easily on a larger number of OSX and Linux flavours:

+ MacOSX PLAST binary: created on OS 10.7.5 (gcc 4.2) 

+ Linux PLAST binary: created on CentOS 6.3 (gcc 4.2.1 ; kernel 2.6.32-279.el6.x86_64 ; 
  GLIBCXX_3.4.13 ; libstdc++.so.6)  

Provided PLAST binaries should work on more recent releases of Linux and OSX. However,
depending on your OS, the provided binaries may not work. In such a case, please download 
source code and compile it on your system.
